# Pharmacy-Management-System
The **Pharmacy Management System** is a console-based application written in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.   It allows **Admins** to manage medicines (add, update, delete, search) and **Customers** to view and search medicines.   All records are stored in a text file (`pharmacy_records.txt`) for persistence.
